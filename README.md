# Solana.Unity.Anchor

Solana.Unity.Anchor is a fork of Solnet.Anchor that generates code compatible with Unity dotnet standard 2.1.

Solana.Unity.Anchor rely on [Solana.Unity-Core](https://github.com/garbles-labs/Solana.Unity-Core) libraries and can be used with the [Solana.Unity-SDK](https://github.com/garbles-labs/Solana.Unity-SDK)

## Features

This repo contains 3 main projects:
- Solana.Unity.Anchor: IDL parsing and code generation
- Solana.Unity.Anchor.Tool: dotnet tool executable that interfaces with the project above.
- Solana.Unity.Anchor.SourceGenerator: Roslyn source generator that depends on the tool above to automatically generate code from IDL in your IDE.

Currently covers all of IDL features with the exception of events and seeds.

## Requirements

Solana.Unity.Anchor and Solana.Unity.Anchor.Tool are compiled and run in net8. Could be easily backported to net5.
Solana.Unity.Anchor.SourceGenerator is compiled in netstandard2.1 to be able to be used as a Roslyn Source Generator. However, machine needs net8 as it just calls Solnet.Anchor.Tool that requires net8.

## Instructions

To compile this project:

`dotnet build`

To use the generator tool:

- `dotnet tool install Solana.Unity.Anchor.Tool` (if you use `-g` option, you won't need to do this for every project')
- `dotnet anchorgen -i idl/file.json -o src/ProgramCode.cs`  
   - You can generate from a live program that uploaded its idl using flag `-a`, or add the default program address if used alongside `-i`
   - You stdout output is supported using `-s` flag

To use the source generator roslyn plugin:

- In your .csproj add `<PackageReference Include="Solnet.Anchor.SourceGenerator" OutputItemType="Analyzer" ReferenceOutputAssembly="false"/>`
- For each project you want to generate sources from an address, add inside `PropertyGroup`: `<AnchorGenerator>address1,address2</AnchorGenerator>`
- For each project you want to generate sources from IDL, add `<AdditionalFiles Include="IdlFile.json" Address="GDDMwNyyx8uB6zrqwBFHjLLG3TBYk2F8Az4yrQC5RzMp" AnchorGenerate="true" />`
